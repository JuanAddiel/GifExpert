# React + Vite

This project is part of a React with JavaScript course I am currently taking. Here, we will create a GifExpert to search for gifs based on our needs. I used the integration of an API to retrieve the data sources. Finally, I conducted a small unit test to check for any potential resulting errors.



## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
```
